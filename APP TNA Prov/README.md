In this folder i deploy a web app to visualize the transfers from the national government to the provinces in Argentina.

We use different types of metrics:
* Transfers per capita
* Transfers in real terms
* Transfers by year
* Ranking of provinces most benefited

The main goal is to show various types of visualizations tools using the seaborn and altari libraries. 
The web app is deploy using Streamlit, which i find it really interesting and easy to use.
